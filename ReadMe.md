# Third year project
## Explanatory Web Document
### Wenyu Wu

A Web user will often want to know more about items mentioned on a Web page. Resources such as DBpedia and DBpedia Spotlight are obvious ways of linking items on a page to other knowledge, in this case of explanatory, factual nature. However, the information returned can be voluminous, redundant and structured in ways that are of little benefit to the user. This project involves two aspects: 1) using DBpedia Spotlight to link items mentioned on a page to DBpedia and 2) investigating ways of presenting the returned information from a link to best advantage from a user's point of view. For example, returned information could be categorised under facets that could then be explored individually. Other filtering and organisation techniques should also be explored. This project therefore is a mixture of interacting with Semantic Web and information extraction resources, and coming up with good HCI ways of presenting the returned information for ease of navigation to aid understanding, with the emphasis being on the second aspect, as this is where an original contribution can be made.
